I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research.

We develop a conceptual framework where tasks across a number of industries are allocated to different types of labor and capital. Automation technologies expand the set of tasks performed by capital, displacing certain worker groups from employment opportunities for which they have comparative advantage. This framework yields a simple equation linking wage changes of a demographic group to the task displacement it experiences. We report robust evidence in favor of this relationship and show that regression models incorporating task displacement explain much of the changes in education differentials between 1980 and 2016. Our task displacement variable captures the effects of automation technologies (and to a lesser degree offshoring) rather than those of rising market power, markups or deunionization, which themselves do not appear to play a major role in US wage inequality. We also propose a methodology for evaluating the full general equilibrium effects of task displacement (which include induced changes in industry composition and ripple effects as tasks are reallocated across different groups). Our quantitative evaluation based on this methodology explains how major changes in wage inequality can go hand-in-hand with modest productivity gains."],"author":["Acemoglu, Daron","Restrepo, Pascual"],"doi":["10.3386/w28920"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/IKMVTDP8/Acemoglu and Restrepo - 2021 - Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in US Wage Inequal.pdf"],"institution":["National Bureau of Economic Research"],"month":["06"],"number":["28920"],"series":["Working Paper Series"],"title":["Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in US Wage Inequality"],"type":["Working Paper"],"year":["2021"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Acemoglu","firstName":"Daron"},{"lastName":"Restrepo","firstName":"Pascual"}]}},{"key":"agnew2007","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["The problem of ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù is a crucial one for any field, particularly perhaps one with as varied a possible repertoire of elementary sources as the study of world politics.

The point is to understand the ontological bases of knowing from perspectives that do not privilege a singular history of knowledge associated with a specific world region or of conceptions of knowledge that implicitly or explicitly presume their self-evident universality.

The past 15 years have seen an explosion of new tools and techniques, and, more importantly, new assumptions and expectations, and these changes have wrecked the old clarity.

Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998.

Graphical models are a suitable framework for probabilistic modelling. A Bayesian Network (BN) is a probabilistic graphical model, which represents joint distributions in an intuitive and efficient way. It encodes the probability density (or mass) function of a set of variables by specifying a number of conditional independence statements in the form of a directed acyclic graph. Specifying the structure of the model is one of the most important design choices in graphical modelling. Notwithstanding their potential, there are several limitations to learning BNs from small data sets. In this paper, we introduce a set of practical guidelines a modeller can use to deal with these limitations. The main goal of the guidelines is to increase awareness of the underlying assumptions and the tacit implications of several learning techniques. Unsurprisingly, one of the authors' findings is that learning BNs from small data sets is a complex and challenging task, yet potentially very rewarding.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

Using a data set that combines information on all articles published in the top-five journals from 1970 to 2012 with their Google Scholar citations, we identify nine key trends. First, annual submissions to the top-five journals nearly doubled from 1990 to 2012. Second, the total number of articles published in these journals actually declined from 400 per year in the late 1970s to 300 per year most recently. As a result, the acceptance rate has fallen from 15 percent to 6 percent, with potential implications for the career progression of young scholars. Third, one journal, the American Economic Review, now accounts for 40 percent of top-five publications, up from 25 percent in the 1970s. Fourth, recently published papers are on average three times longer than they were in the 1970s, contributing to the relative shortage of journal space. Fifth, the number of authors per paper has increased from 1.3 in 1970 to 2.3 in 2012, partly offsetting the fall in the number of articles per year. Sixth, citations for top-five publications are high: among papers published in the late 1990s, the median number of Google Scholar citations is 200. Seventh, the ranking of journals by citations has remained relatively stable, with the notable exception of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, which climbed from fourth place to first place over the past three decades.

And few individuals have done more to shape Silicon Valley than billionaire venture capitalist and entrepreneur Peter Thiel. From the technologies we use every day to the delicate power balance between Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and Washington, Thiel has been a behind-the-scenes operator influencing countless aspects of our contemporary way of life. But despite his power and the ubiquity of his projects, no public figure is quite so mysterious. In the first major biography of Thiel, Max Chafkin traces the trajectory of the innovator's singular life and worldview, from his upbringing as the child of immigrant parents and years at Stanford as a burgeoning conservative thought leader to his founding of PayPal and Palantir, early investment in Facebook and SpaceX, and relationships with fellow tech titans Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Eric Schmidt. The Contrarian illuminates the extent to which Thiel has sought to export his values to the corridors of power beyond Silicon Valley, including funding the lawsuit that bankrupted the blog Gawker to strenuously backing far-right political candidates, including Donald Trump for president in 2016. Eye-opening and deeply reported, The Contrarian is a revelatory biography of a one-of-a-kind leader and an incisive portrait of a tech industry whose explosive growth and power is both thrilling and fraught with controversy\"‚Äì"],"address":["New York"],"author":["Chafkin, Max"],"isbn":["978-1-984878-53-3"],"keywords":["‚úÖ"],"lccn":["HG172.T46 C43 2021"],"publisher":["Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC"],"shorttitle":["The contrarian"],"title":["The contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley's pursuit of power"],"year":["2021"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Chafkin","firstName":"Max"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"chang2014","type":"book","fields":{"abstract":["\"Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline, Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories‚Äìfrom the Classical economists to the Behavioral economists, from the Marxists to the Austrians‚Äìrevealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses and why there is no one correct way to explain economic behavior.

Drawing on ethnographic material, we identify five key relational strategies: moral boundary-drawing between \"good\" and \"bad\" metrics, strategic invocation of \"best-case scenarios,\" domestication through bespoke metrics, reframing metrics as democratic feedback, and justifying metrics as organizational subsidies. We then turn to cases of failure and document a process that we call overspelling, which can coincide with organizational breakdown.

To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power ‚Äî including a more \"static\" form of power based on status differences, and a more \"situational\" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another.

There would be nothing to describe, nothing to explain, remark, interpret, or complain about. Without things, we would stop speaking; we would become as mute as things are alleged to be. In nine original essays, internationally renowned historians of art and of science seek to understand how objects become charged with significance without losing their gritty materiality. True to the particularity of things, each of the essays singles out one object for close attention: a Bosch drawing, the freestanding column, a Prussian island, soap bubbles, early photographs, glass flowers, Rorschach blots, newspaper clippings, paintings by Jackson Pollock. Each is revealed to be a node around which meanings accrete thickly. But not just any meanings: what these things are made of and how they are made shape what they can mean. Neither the pure texts of semiotics nor the brute objects of positivism, these things are saturated with cultural significance. Things become talkative when they fuse matter and meaning; they lapse into speechlessness when their matter and meanings no longer mesh.Each of the nine objects examined in this book had its historical moment, when the match of this thing to that thought seemed irresistible. At these junctures, certain things become objects of fascination, association, and endless consideration; they begin to talk. Things that talk fleetingly realize the dream of a perfect language, in which words and world merge.Contributors:Lorraine Daston, Peter Galison, Anke te Heesen, Caroline A.

Drawing from a diverse set of disciplinary and theoretical backgrounds, research paradigms and perspectives, and methodologies, each chapter explores different institutions currently impacting journalism, including government bodies, businesses, technological platforms, and civic organisations. Together they outline how cracks in the autonomy of the journalism industry have allowed for other types of organizations to exert influence over the manner in which journalism is produced, funded, experienced and even conceptualized. Ultimately, this collective work argues for increased research on the impact of outside influences on journalism, while providing a roadmap for future research within journalism studies.

The difficulty of rethinking our assumptions is surprisingly common‚Äìmaybe even fundamentally human. Our ways of thinking become habits that we don't bother to question, and mental laziness leads us to prefer the ease of old routines to the difficulty of new ones. We fail to update the beliefs we formed in the past for the challenges we face in the present. But in a rapidly changing world, we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. Think Again is a book about the benefit of doubt, and about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong. Evidence has shown that creative geniuses are not attached to one identity but constantly willing to rethink their stances, that leaders who admit they don't know something and seek critical feedback lead more productive and innovative teams, and that our greatest presidents have been open to updating their views. The new science of intellectual humility shows that as a mindset and a skillset, rethinking can be taught, and Grant explains how to develop the necessary qualities. The first section of the book explores why we struggle to think again and how we can improve individually, and argues that such engines of success as \"grit\" can actually be counterproductive; the second section discusses how we can help others think again through the skill of \"argument literacy\"; and the third looks at how institutions like schools, business, and governments fall short in building cultures that encourage rethinking.

Through shared epistemic standards and the professional norm of objectivity, journalism helps to generate societal knowledge and to make informed decisions. Yet, this surveillance function is also driven by knowledge about audiences. Knowledge about audiences informs both journalism's and mutual recipients' expectations toward anticipated audiences. It allows to gauge shared epistemic standards and thus to reduce risks of criticism when participating in public discourse. Online, changes in possibilities and necessities to monitor audiences, however, have paved the way to engage in a mode of addressing more tailored standards of anticipated audiences. Such epistemic tribalism contrasts widely shared epistemic standards of professional journalism and has yielded a paradox in which an increase in knowledge about audiences possibly leads to less common knowledge about current events because epistemic standards are no longer shared across the public. Based on this diagnose, we offer two potential pathways for the future of epistemic standards on the internet. A negative one where polarization will benefit from an intensified identification with epistemic tribes and a positive one where discursive spaces will allow for an institutionalized rebalancing of epistemic standards between journalism and audiences. , Der Journalismus ist f√ºr moderne Demokratien wichtig, weil er valides Wissen √ºber aktuelle Ereignisse in Form von Nachrichten produziert. Gesellschaftlich akzeptierte epistemische Standards und die professionelle Objektivit√§tsnorm tragen zum gesellschaftlichen Wissensvorrat bei und erm√∂glichen fundierte Entscheidungen. Erg√§nzt wird diese journalistische Funktion der Umweltbeobachtung durch das Wissen √ºber das Publikum. Das Wissen √ºber das Publikum bestimmt sowohl die Erwartungen des Journalismus als auch jene der Rezipierenden an das Mitpublikum. Es erm√∂glicht die Herausbildung gemeinsamer epistemischer Standards, wodurch sich das Risiko von Kritik bei der Teilnahme am √∂ffentlichen Diskurs verringert. Die ver√§nderten M√∂glichkeiten und auch Notwendigkeiten der Publikumsbeobachtung im Internet haben den Weg daf√ºr geebnet, dass sich Redaktionen mit ma√ügeschneiderten epistemischen Standards an das erwartete Publikum wenden. Ein solcher zielgruppenspezifischer Zuschnitt epistemischer Standards steht im Gegensatz zu geteilten Normen und hat zum Paradoxon gef√ºhrt, dass die Zunahme des Wissens √ºber das Publikum m√∂glicherweise mit weniger gemeinsam geteiltem Wissen √ºber aktuelle Ereignisse einhergeht, weil professionelle Standards nicht mehr geteilt werden.

Both a major declaration of a new research programme and a conciseintroduction to David Harvey's central concerns, this book will be essentialreading for scholars and students across the humanities and social sciences."],"author":["Harvey, David"],"isbn":["1-84467-065-1"],"publisher":["Verso"],"title":["Spaces of Global Capitalism"],"year":["2006"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Harvey","firstName":"David"}]}},{"key":"hay2017","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"annotation":["OCLC: 1295169941"],"author":["Hay, Colin"],"isbn":["978-1-350-31800-7"],"keywords":["‚è≥"],"title":["Political analysis"],"year":["2017"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Hay","firstName":"Colin"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"heikkila2022","type":"incollection","fields":{"langid":["english"],"address":["Cham"],"author":["Heikkil√§, Heikki"],"booktitle":["Futures of Journalism"],"doi":["10.1007/978-3-030-95073-6_8"],"editor":["Manninen, Ville J.

Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of `technical critique' are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre's work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily `a-critical' or `uncritical' in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: `does it work?'. Drawing on Agre's studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the `Cartesian soul' of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, `narrow' and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach ‚Äì via the work of Philip Agre ‚Äì to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry."],"author":["Hind, Sam","Seitz, Tatjana"],"doi":["10.1177/13548565221133248"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/9ZY9TPBE/Hind and Seitz - 2022 - Cynical technical practice From AI to APIs.pdf"],"issn":["1354-8565, 1748-7382"],"journal":["Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies"],"month":["10"],"pages":["135485652211332"],"shorttitle":["Cynical technical practice"],"title":["Cynical technical practice: From AI to APIs"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Hind","firstName":"Sam"},{"lastName":"Seitz","firstName":"Tatjana"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"holtz-bacha2012","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["A collection of original essays drawing together international research on the media's use of opinion polls, covering both theoretical and methodological approaches.

Almost immediately after a social interaction begins, verbal and nonverbal behaviors become synchronized. Even in asocial contexts, individuals tend to produce utterances that match the grammatical structure of sentences they have recently heard or read. Three projects explore language style matching (LSM) in everyday writing tasks and professional writing. LSM is the relative use of 9 function word categories (e.g., articles, personal pronouns) between any 2 texts. In the first project, 2 samples totaling 1,744 college students answered 4 essay questions written in very different styles. Students automatically matched the language style of the target questions. Overall, the LSM metric was internally consistent and reliable across writing tasks. Women, participants of higher socioeconomic status, and students who earned higher test grades matched with targets more than others did. In the second project, 74 participants completed cliffhanger excerpts from popular fiction. Judges' ratings of excerpt-response similarity were related to content matching but not function word matching, as indexed by LSM. Further, participants were not able to intentionally increase style or content matching. In the final project, an archival study tracked the professional writing and personal correspondence of 3 pairs of famous writers across their relationships. Language matching in poetry and letters reflected fluctuations in the relationships of 3 couples: Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Implications for using LSM as an implicit marker of social engagement and influence are discussed.

First, building on previous studies, we show how errors in national polls evolve in a structured way over the election timeline. Second, we examine errors in polls in the final week of the election campaign to assess performance across election years. Third, we undertake a pooled analysis of polling errors‚Äîcontrolling for a number of institutional and party features‚Äîthat enables us to test whether poll errors have increased or decreased over time.

Volunteer bias is systematic error due to differences between those who choose to participate in studies and those who do not. Methods and Results This paper extends the applications of the concept of volunteer bias by using data from a trial of probiotic supplementation for childhood atopy in healthy dyads to explore 1) differences between a) trial participants and aggregated data from publicly available databases b) participants and non-participants as the trial progressed 2) impact on trial findings of weighting data according to deprivation (Townsend) fifths in the sample and target populations. 1) a) Recruits (n1mu=1mu454) were less deprived than the target population, matched for area of residence and delivery dates (n1mu=1mu6,893) (mean [SD] deprivation scores 0.09[4.21] and 0.79[4.08], t1mu=1mu3.44, df1mu=1mu511, p<0.001). b) i)As the trial progressed, representation of the most deprived decreased. These participants and smokers were less likely to be retained at 6 months (n1mu=1mu430[95%]) (OR 0.29,0.13‚Äì0.67 and 0.20,0.09‚Äì0.46), and 2 years (n1mu=1mu380[84%]) (aOR 0.68,0.50‚Äì0.93 and 0.55,0.28‚Äì1.09), and consent to infant blood sample donation (n1mu=1mu220[48%]) (aOR 0.72,0.57‚Äì0.92 and 0.43,0.22‚Äì0.83). ii)Mothers interested in probiotics or research or reporting infants' adverse events or rashes were more likely to attend research clinics and consent to skin-prick testing. Mothers participating to help children were more likely to consent to infant blood sample donation. 2) In one trial outcome, atopic eczema, the intervention had a positive effect only in the over-represented, least deprived group. Here, data weighting attenuated risk reduction from 6.9%(0.9‚Äì13.1%) to 4.6%(-1.4‚Äì+10.5%), and OR from 0.40(0.18‚Äì0.91) to 0.56(0.26‚Äì1.21). Other findings were unchanged. Conclusions Potential for volunteer bias intensified during the trial, due to non-participation of the most deprived and smokers. However, these were not the only predictors of non-participation. Data weighting quantified volunteer bias and modified one important trial outcome.

Our study aims to determine how and where young people can be reached with news. It uses a mixed methods approach to analyze the expectations of young people towards news content and formats and to determine their news consumption patterns. The results show that young people's news consumption is characterized by four dimensions: 1. duration and times of consumption, 2. news consumption habits and behavior, 3. restrictions, 4. media literacy. The significance of these dimensions varies between three age groups determined through the study. The news consumption of the 12-to-14¬†year-olds is strongly restricted by parents and school. This group consumes news mainly through media available at home. In the group of 15- to-17¬†year-olds, parental influence and restrictions decrease, while peer influence increases. This age group spends a lot of time on social media platforms where young people stumble upon news rather accidentally. Between 18 and 20¬†years of age, news consumption stabilizes, and individual patterns emerge. This age group accesses news via selected apps and social media channels. Young people in Switzerland prefer visual formats like pictures, videos, and memes.

Clicking patterns are often seen as evidence that news users are mostly interested in junk news, leading to concerns about the state of journalism and the implications for society. Asking and observing how 56 users actually browse news and what clicking and not clicking mean to them, we identified 30 distinct considerations for (not) clicking and classified them into three categories: cognitive, affective and pragmatic. The results suggest, first, that interest is too crude a term to account for the variety of people's considerations for (not) clicking. Second, even if one aims for roughly estimating people's news interests, clicks are a flawed instrument because a lack of clicking does not measure people's lack of interest in news. Third, taking users' browsing patterns seriously could help bridge the gap between what people need as citizens and what they actually consume. Finally, we argue that all metrics should be critically assessed from a user perspective rather than taken at face value."],"author":["Kormelink, Tim Groot","Meijer, Irene Costera"],"doi":["10.1177/1464884916688290"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/ZQ3R2GSS/Kormelink and Meijer - 2018 - What clicks actually mean Exploring digital news .pdf"],"issn":["1464-8849, 1741-3001"],"journal":["Journalism"],"month":["05"],"number":["5"],"pages":["668‚Äì683"],"shorttitle":["What clicks actually mean"],"title":["What clicks actually mean: Exploring digital news user practices"],"volume":["19"],"year":["2018"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Kormelink","firstName":"Tim Groot"},{"lastName":"Meijer","firstName":"Irene Costera"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"krauthammer1990","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Krauthammer, Charles"],"doi":["10.2307/20044692"],"eprint":["20044692"],"eprinttype":["jstor"],"issn":["0015-7120"],"journal":["Foreign Affairs"],"number":["1"],"pages":["23‚Äì33"],"publisher":["Council on Foreign Relations"],"title":["The Unipolar Moment"],"volume":["70"],"year":["1990"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Krauthammer","firstName":"Charles"}]}},{"key":"lacoste2013","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["fre"],"address":["Paris"],"author":["Lacoste, Yves"],"edition":["√âd. augment√©e"],"isbn":["978-2-7071-7836-7"],"keywords":["‚úÖ","üí°"],"lccn":["910.01"],"publisher":["la D√©couverte"],"series":["La D√©couverte-poche"],"title":["La g√©ographie, √ßa sert, d'abord, √† faire la guerre"],"year":["2013"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Lacoste","firstName":"Yves"}]}},{"key":"lakoff2003","type":"book","fields":{"address":["Chicago"],"author":["Lakoff, George","Johnson, Mark"],"isbn":["978-0-226-46801-3"],"lccn":["P106 .L235 2003"],"publisher":["University of Chicago Press"],"title":["Metaphors we live by"],"year":["2003"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Lakoff","firstName":"George"},{"lastName":"Johnson","firstName":"Mark"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"landis2022","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"author":["Landis, Benjamin Till","Allen, William L."],"doi":["10.1080/21670811.2021.1962728"],"issn":["2167-0811, 2167-082X"],"journal":["Digital Journalism"],"month":["04"],"number":["4"],"pages":["537‚Äì555"],"shorttitle":["Cascading Activation Revisited"],"title":["Cascading Activation Revisited: How Audiences Contribute to News Agendas Using Social Media"],"volume":["10"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Landis","firstName":"Benjamin Till"},{"lastName":"Allen","firstName":"William L."}]}},{"key":"larsen2022","type":"misc","fields":{"abstract":["The rise of internet-based services and products in the late 1990's brought about an unprecedented opportunity for online businesses to engage in large scale data-driven decision making. Over the past two decades, organizations such as Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Booking, Alphabet's Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Meta's Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber, and Yandex have invested tremendous resources in online controlled experiments (OCEs) to assess the impact of innovation on their customers and businesses. Running OCEs at scale has presented a host of challenges requiring solutions from many domains. In this paper we review challenges that require new statistical methodologies to address them. In particular, we discuss the practice and culture of online experimentation, as well as its statistics literature, placing the current methodologies within their relevant statistical lineages and providing illustrative examples of OCE applications.

What is conceived as an individual and what as a class is thus relative to the discourse within which the conception occurs. One task of applied logic is to determine which entities are to be construed as individuals and which as classes when the purpose is the development of a comprehensive systematic discourse. The concept of an individual and that of a class may be regarded as different devices for distinguishing one segment of the total universe from all that remains. In both cases, the differentiated segment is potentially divisible, and may even be physically discontinuous. The difference in the concepts lies in this: that to conceive a segment as a whole or individual offers no suggestion as to what these subdivisions, if any, must be, whereas to conceive a segment as a class imposes a definite scheme of subdivision‚Äîinto subclasses and members. The relations of segments of the universe are treated in traditional logistic at two places, first in its theorems concerning the identity and diversity of individuals, and second in its calculus of membership and class-inclusion. But further relations of segments and of classes frequently demand consideration. For example, what is the relation of the class of windows to the class of buildings? No member of either class is a member of the other, nor are any of the segments isolated by the one concept identical with segments isolated by the other. Yet the classes themselves have a very definite relation in that each window is a part of some building. We cannot express this fact in the language of a logistic which lacks a part-whole relation between individuals unless, by making use of some special physical theory, we raise the logical type of each window and each building to the level of a class‚Äîsay a class of atoms‚Äîsuch that any class of atoms that is a window will be included (class-inclusion) in some class that is a building. Such an unfortunate dependence of logical formulation upon the discovery and adoption of a special physical theory, or even upon the presumption that such a suitable theory could in every case be discovered in the course of time, indicates serious deficiencies in the ordinary logistic. Furthermore, a raising of type like that illustrated above is often precluded in a constructional system by other considerations governing the choice of primitive ideas."],"author":["Leonard, Henry S.","Goodman, Nelson"],"doi":["10.2307/2266169"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/6XM3AKWP/Leonard_Goodman_1940_The calculus of individuals and its uses.pdf"],"issn":["0022-4812, 1943-5886"],"journal":["Journal of Symbolic Logic"],"month":["06"],"number":["2"],"pages":["45‚Äì55"],"title":["The calculus of individuals and its uses"],"volume":["5"],"year":["1940"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Leonard","firstName":"Henry S."},{"lastName":"Goodman","firstName":"Nelson"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"letexier2022","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["french"],"abstract":["La physionomie de nos soci??t??s d??pend de vendeurs et d'acheteurs qui ne se rencontrent plus comme autrefois sur les march??s de plein air ou dans les ateliers des artisans.

Lewis argues that the philosophical utility of modal realism is a good reason for believing that it is true. After putting forward the type of modal realism he favors, Lewis answers numerous objections that have been raised against it. These include an insistence that everything must be actual; paradoxes akin to those that confront naive set theory; arguments that modal realism leads to inductive skepticism, or to disregard for prudence and morality; and finally, sheer incredulity at a theory that disagrees so badly with common opinion. Lewis grants the weight of the last objection, but takes it to be outweighed by the benefits to systematic theory that acceptance of modal realism brings. He asks whether these same benefits might be gained more cheaply if we replace his many worlds by many merely 'abstract' representations; but concludes that all versions of this 'ersatz modal realism' are in serious trouble. In the final chapter, Lewis distinguishes various questions about trans-world identity, and argues that his 'method of counterparts' is preferable to alternative approaches."],"author":["Lewis, David"],"isbn":["978-0-631-22496-9"],"publisher":["Wiley"],"title":["On the Plurality of Worlds"],"year":["1986"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Lewis","firstName":"David"}]}},{"key":"lialina2021","type":"book","fields":{"author":["Lialina, Olia"],"doi":["10.11588/ARTHISTORICUM.972"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/NHE5QES9/Lialina - 2021 - Turing Complete User.pdf"],"publisher":["arthistoricum.net"],"title":["Turing Complete User"],"year":["2021"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Lialina","firstName":"Olia"}]}},{"key":"lonergan2020","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["\"Economics increasingly fails to explain why the pressures of life appear to be intensifying at the same time as income per capita is rising, or why we work more hours for less money in real terms.

Rather much of the new transnational politics is intensely focused on specific locations, identities, and issues (for example, ‚Äúglobalized‚Äù neighborhood associations, ethnicities, patrimonialism). Transnational politics also includes new conceptions and practices of citizenship and accountability (for example, legislative seats reserved for expatriate labor migrants) as the body politic becomes increasing mobile, political affinities delinked from geographic proximity, and critical constituencies reside outside of the territory of the state.

It discusses why the shift from epistemology to ontology in science and technology studies has proved inconclusive for the study of politics and democracy: the politics of non-humans has been assumed to operate on a different level from that of politics and democracy understood as institutional and public forms. I distinguish between three different understandings of political ontology: theoretical, empirical and experimental. Each of these implies a different approach to the problem that non-humans pose for democracy. Theoretical ontology proposes to solve it by conceptual means, while empirical ontology renders it manageable by assuming a problematic analytic separation between constituting and constituted ontologies. This article makes the case for the third approach, experimental ontology, by analysing an empirical site, that of the eco-show home. In this setting, material entities are deliberately invested with moral and political capacities. As such, eco-show homes help to clarify two main features of experimental political ontology: (1) ontological work is here not so much relocated from theory to empirical practice but distributed among relevant actors and registers and (2) normative variability does not just pertain to the enactment of things but can be conceived of as internal to political objects. From these two features of experimental ontology, something follows for democracy as an ontological problem. This problem does not dissolve in empirical settings, but these settings make possible its articulation by experimental means."],"author":["Marres, Noortje"],"doi":["10.1177/0306312712475255"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/KK4KIPFU/Social Studies of Science-2013-Marres-0306312712475255.pdf;/home/tk/Zotero/storage/6T8ZEJI6/Marres - 2013 - Why political ontology must be experimentalized O.html"],"issn":["0306-3127, 1460-3659"],"journal":["Social Studies of Science"],"keywords":["STS"],"month":["04"],"shorttitle":["Why political ontology must be experimentalized"],"title":["Why political ontology must be experimentalized: On ecoshowhomes as devices of participation"],"year":["2013"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Marres","firstName":"Noortje"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"mattei2022","type":"book","fields":{"abstract":["\"For more than a century, governments facing financial crisis have resorted to the economic policies of austerity-cuts to wages, fiscal spending, and public benefits-as a means to regain solvency. While these policies have been successful in appeasing creditors, they've had devastating effects on social and economic welfare in countries all over the world. Today, as austerity remains a favored policy among troubled states, an important question remains: what if solvency was never really the goal? In Capital Order, political economist Clara E. Mattei traces the intellectual origins of austerity to uncover its originating motives: the protection of capital-and indeed capitalism-in times of social upheaval from below. Mattei traces modern austerity to its origins in interwar Britain and Italy, revealing how the threat of working-class power in the years after World War I animated a set of top-down economic policies that elevated owners, smothered workers, and imposed a rigid economic hierarchy across their societies. Where these policies \"succeeded,\" relatively speaking, was in their enrichment of certain parties, including employers and foreign-trade interests, who accumulated power and capital at the expense of labor.

The data come from a nationwide survey applied to 30 editors-in-chief of Spain's leading newspapers, radios, televisions, and digital natives. We study the newsroom size, news sections weight, freelancers, news agencies, and gender with multivariable analysis. We found that the gender gap has been overcome, and women are mostly in newsrooms (61%). Despite progress, women continue to have higher levels of unemployment and keep facing a glass ceiling in accessing the top positions. They just account for only 6.6% of the editors-in-chief in the sample. Likewise, we found a correlation between female journalists and the Society news section size. Findings suggest a specific news production organization by analyzing newsroom journalistic practice. Politics (23%) is the main news section and in decreasing order of importance: Society (18.5%), Business (16.5%), Sport (16.5%), International (14%) and Culture (11.5%). The average newsroom has between 101 and 300 journalists, with less than 20% freelancers. The media industry demands a polyvalent journalist. Skills, abilities, and competencies that different professionals previously developed now converge in a single professional with a polyvalent and multitasking profile. We found that it is a widespread journalistic practice in most TV outlets for reporters to work for several daily editions of newscasts (midday and night) and even provide news content for other organization shows. Journalists no longer work for a specific section, not even for a news show, but they now work for the entire organization."],"author":["Mayo-Cubero, Marcos"],"doi":["10.15581/003.35.3.1-14"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/MS2GSLJP/Mayo-Cubero - 2022 - A multivariable analysis on news production in Spa.pdf"],"issn":["2386-7876"],"journal":["Communication & Society"],"month":["06"],"number":["3"],"pages":["1‚Äì14"],"shorttitle":["A multivariable analysis on news production in Spain"],"title":["A multivariable analysis on news production in Spain: Digital newsroom profile, polyvalent journalists and gender perspective"],"volume":["35"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Mayo-Cubero","firstName":"Marcos"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"mayo1996","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"annotation":["OCLC: 939782106"],"author":["Mayo, Deborah G"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/HHNJU97W/Mayo - 1996 - Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge (Sc.pdf"],"isbn":["978-0-226-51199-3"],"keywords":["‚è≥"],"publisher":["University of Chicago Press"],"title":["Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge (Science and its conceptual foundations)"],"year":["1996"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Mayo","firstName":"Deborah G"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"mazzucato2015","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["Companies like Google and Apple heralded the information revolution, and opened the doors for Silicon Valley to grow into an engine of dazzling technological development, that today champions the free market that engendered it against the supposedly stifling encroachment of government regulation. But is that really the case' In this sharp and controversial expose, The Entrepreneurial State, Mariana Mazzucato debunks the pervasive myth that the state is a laggard, bureaucratic apparatus at odds with a dynamic private sector. Instead she reveals in case study after case study that, in fact, the opposite is true: the state is our boldest and most valuable innovator. The technology revolution would never have happened without support from the US Government. The breakthroughs'GPS, touch-screen displays, the Internet, and voice-activated AI'that enabled legendary Apple products to be smart successes were, in fact, all developed with support from the state. Mazzucato reveals that many successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs integrated state-funded technological developments into their products and then reaped the rewards themselves. The algorithm behind Google's search engine was initially sponsored by NASA. And 75% of NMEs'new, often-ground-breaking drugs not derivative of existing substances'trace their research to National Institutes of Health (NIH) labs. The American government, it turns out, has been enormously successfully at stimulating scientific and technological advancement. But by 2009, just some months following the Great Recession'the US government, constrained by austerity measures, started disinvesting from its holdings in research fields like health, energy, electronics. The trend is likely to continue, and the repercussions of these policies could wreak havoc on our technology and science sectors. But Mazzucato remains optimistic. If managed correctly, state-sponsored development of Green technology, for instance, could be as efficacious as suburbanization & post-war reconstruction in the mid-twentieth century, and unleash a wide-spread golden age in the global economy. The limitations of natural resources and the threat of global warming could become the most powerful driver of growth, employment, and innovation within just one generation'but to be successful, the Green Revolution will depend on the initiatives of proactive governments. By not admitting the State's role in economic and technological progress, we are socializing only the risks of investing in innovation, while privatizing the rewards in the hands of only a few businesses. This, Mazzucato argues, hurts both future of innovation and equity in modern-day capitalism. For policy-makers, Silicon Valley start-up founders, venture-capitalists, and economists alike, The Entrepreneurial State stirs up much needed debate and offers up a brilliant corrective to spurious beliefs: to thrive, American businesses have always and will need to depend on the support of our country's most audacious entrepreneur, the state"],"address":["New York"],"annotation":["OCLC: 946536672"],"author":["Mazzucato, Mariana"],"isbn":["978-1-61039-614-1"],"keywords":["‚è≥"],"publisher":["PublicAffairs"],"shorttitle":["The entrepreneurial state"],"title":["The entrepreneurial state: Debunking public vs. Private sector myths"],"year":["2015"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Mazzucato","firstName":"Mariana"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"mazzucato2018","type":"book","fields":{"abstract":["\"Who really creates wealth in our world?

In theory, tournaments advance the goals of ‚Äúdeliberative democracy‚Äù by incentivizing people to be flexible belief updaters whose views converge in response to facts, thus depolarizing unnecessarily polarized debates. We examine the hypothesis that, in the process of thinking critically about their beliefs, tournament participants become more moderate in their own political attitudes and those they attribute to the other side.

However, much evidence shows that reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments intended to persuade. Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled arguers, however, are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing, but also when they are reasoning proactively from the perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily better. In all these instances traditionally described as failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for which arguments can be found."],"author":["Mercier, Hugo","Sperber, Dan"],"doi":["10.1017/S0140525X10000968"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/85CCNLIM/Mercier and Sperber - 2011 - Why do humans reason Arguments for an argumentati.pdf"],"issn":["0140-525X, 1469-1825"],"journal":["Behavioral and Brain Sciences"],"month":["04"],"number":["2"],"pages":["57‚Äì74"],"shorttitle":["Why do humans reason?"],"title":["Why do humans reason?

Until recently, America designed and built the fastest chips and maintained its lead as the #1 superpower. Now, America's edge is slipping, undermined by competitors in Taiwan, Korea, Europe, and, above all, China. Today, as Chip War reveals, China, which spends more money each year importing chips than it spends importing oil, is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. At stake is America's military superiority and economic prosperity. Economic historian Chris Miller explains how the semiconductor came to play a critical role in modern life and how the U.S. become dominant in chip design and manufacturing and applied this technology to military systems. America's victory in the Cold War and its global military dominance stems from its ability to harness computing power more effectively than any other power. But here, too, China is catching up, with its chip-building ambitions and military modernization going hand in hand. America has let key components of the chip-building process slip out of its grasp, contributing not only to a worldwide chip shortage but also a new Cold War with a superpower adversary that is desperate to bridge the gap.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation."],"archiveprefix":["arxiv"],"author":["Mitchell, Margaret","Wu, Simone","Zaldivar, Andrew","Barnes, Parker","Vasserman, Lucy","Hutchinson, Ben","Spitzer, Elena","Raji, Inioluwa Deborah","Gebru, Timnit"],"doi":["10.1145/3287560.3287596"],"eprint":["1810.03993"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/W7H3M8AW/Mitchell et al_2019_Model Cards for Model Reporting.pdf;/home/tk/Zotero/storage/Z5WUISEH/1810.html"],"journal":["Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency"],"keywords":["‚úÖ","üí°"],"month":["01"],"pages":["220‚Äì229"],"title":["Model Cards for Model Reporting"],"year":["2019"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Mitchell","firstName":"Margaret"},{"lastName":"Wu","firstName":"Simone"},{"lastName":"Zaldivar","firstName":"Andrew"},{"lastName":"Barnes","firstName":"Parker"},{"lastName":"Vasserman","firstName":"Lucy"},{"lastName":"Hutchinson","firstName":"Ben"},{"lastName":"Spitzer","firstName":"Elena"},{"lastName":"Raji","firstName":"Inioluwa Deborah"},{"lastName":"Gebru","firstName":"Timnit"}]}},{"key":"mizruchi2004","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["In The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), Berle and Means warned of the concentration of economic power brought on by the rise of the large corporation and the emergence of a powerful class of professional managers, insulated from the pressure not only of stockholders, but of the larger public as well. In the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, Berle and Means warned that the ascendance of management control and unchecked corporate power had potentially serious consequences for the democratic character of the United States. Social scientists who drew on Berle and Means in subsequent decades presented a far more benign interpretation of the rise of managerialism, however. For them, the separation of ownership from control actually led to an increased level of democratization in the society as a whole. Beginning in the late 1960s, sociologists and other social scientists rekindled the debate over ownership and control, culminating in a series of rigorous empirical studies on the nature of corporate power in American society. In recent years, however, sociologists have largely abandoned the topic, ceding it to finance economists, legal scholars, and corporate strategy researchers. In this article, I provide a brief history of the sociological and finance/legal/strategy debates over corporate ownership and control. I discuss some of the similarities between the two streams of thought, and I discuss the reasons that the issue was of such significance sociologically. I then argue that by neglecting this topic in recent years, sociologists have failed to contribute to an understanding of some of the key issues in contemporary business behavior. I provide brief reviews of four loosely developed current perspectives and then present an argument of my own about the changing nature of the U.S. corporate elite over the past three decades.

Whether regional variations in social vulnerability to disasters influence COVID-19 outcomes and incidence in the U.S. is unknown. Objective To examine the association of Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of county-level social vulnerability to disasters, and its sub-components (socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type/transportation accessibility) with the case fatality rate (CFR) and incidence of COVID-19. Design Ecological study of counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 4th, 2020. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with state-level clustering were applied to estimate county-level associations of overall SVI and its sub-component scores with COVID-19 CFR (deaths/100 cases) and incidence (cases/1000 population), adjusting for population percentage aged >65 years, and for comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score. Counties with high SVI (‚â•median) and high CFR (‚â•median) were identified. Setting Population-based study of U.S. county-level data. Participants U.S. counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Main outcomes and measures COVID-19 CFR and incidence. Results Data from 433 counties including 283,256 cases and 6,644 deaths were analyzed. Median SVI was 0.46 [Range: 0.01-1.00], and median CFR and incidence were 1.9% [Range: 0-13.3] and 1.2 per 1000 people [Range: 0.6-38.8], respectively. Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was associated with higher CFR (RR: 1.19 [1.05, 1.34], p=0.005, per-1 unit increase), an association that strengthened after adjustment for age>65 years and comorbidities (RR: 1.63 [1.38, 1.91], p<0.001), and was further confirmed in a sensitivity analysis limited to six states with the highest testing levels. Although the association between overall SVI and COVID-19 incidence was not significant, the SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status and minority status were both predictors of higher incidence and CFR. A combination of high SVI (‚â•0.46) and high adjusted CFR (‚â•2.3%) was observed in 28.9% of counties. Conclusions and Relevance Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality. High social vulnerability and CFR coexist in more than 1 in 4 U.S. counties. These counties should be targeted by public policy interventions to help alleviate the pandemic burden on the most vulnerable population."],"author":["Nayak, Aditi","Islam, Shabatun J.","Mehta, Anurag","Ko, Yi-An","Patel, Shivani A.","Goyal, Abhinav","Sullivan, Samaah","Lewis, Tene T.","Vaccarino, Viola","Morris, Alanna A.","Quyyumi, Arshed A."],"doi":["10.1101/2020.04.10.20060962"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/TZ5ANQHG/Nayak et al. - 2020 - Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 Inciden.pdf"],"journal":["medRxiv: The Preprint Server for Health Sciences"],"month":["04"],"pages":["2020.04.10.20060962"],"pmcid":["PMC7217093"],"pmid":["32511437"],"title":["Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 Incidence and Outcomes in the United States"],"year":["2020"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Nayak","firstName":"Aditi"},{"lastName":"Islam","firstName":"Shabatun J."},{"lastName":"Mehta","firstName":"Anurag"},{"lastName":"Ko","firstName":"Yi-An"},{"lastName":"Patel","firstName":"Shivani A."},{"lastName":"Goyal","firstName":"Abhinav"},{"lastName":"Sullivan","firstName":"Samaah"},{"lastName":"Lewis","firstName":"Tene T."},{"lastName":"Vaccarino","firstName":"Viola"},{"lastName":"Morris","firstName":"Alanna A."},{"lastName":"Quyyumi","firstName":"Arshed A."}]}},{"key":"neurath2010","type":"book","fields":{"author":["Neurath, Otto"],"isbn":["0-907259-44-8"],"month":["10"],"publisher":["Hyphen Press"],"shorttitle":["From Hieroglyphics to Isotype"],"title":["From Hieroglyphics to Isotype: A Visual Autobiography"],"year":["2010"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Neurath","firstName":"Otto"}]}},{"key":"newman2013","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["Many methods have been proposed for community detection in networks.

Cultural content producers have to continuously grapple with seemingly serendipitous changes in platform governance, ranging from content curation to pricing strategies. Simultaneously, these producers are enticed by new platform services and infrastructural changes. In the process, cultural commodities become fundamentally ‚Äúcontingent,‚Äù that is increasingly modular in design and continuously reworked and repackaged, informed by datafied user feedback."],"author":["Nieborg, David B","Poell, Thomas"],"doi":["10.1177/1461444818769694"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/2E8LSPKJ/Nieborg and Poell - 2018 - The platformization of cultural production Theori.pdf"],"issn":["1461-4448, 1461-7315"],"journal":["New Media & Society"],"month":["11"],"number":["11"],"pages":["4275‚Äì4292"],"shorttitle":["The platformization of cultural production"],"title":["The platformization of cultural production: Theorizing the contingent cultural commodity"],"volume":["20"],"year":["2018"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Nieborg","firstName":"David B"},{"lastName":"Poell","firstName":"Thomas"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"nieborg2020","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["This introduction to the second special collection of articles on the platformization of the cultural industries foregrounds research methods and practices.

We propose a minimal-model semantics of causation, and show that, contrary to common folklore, genuine causal influences can be distinguished from spurious covariations following standard norms of inductive reasoning. We also establish a sound characterization of the conditions under which such a distinction is possible. We provide an effective algorithm for inferred causation and show that, for a large class of data the algorithm can uncover the direction of causal influences as defined above.

In the earlier days of web analytics, editorial metrics had both enthusiastic proponents and impassioned detractors. Nowadays the prevailing view is that metrics aren't, by definition, good or bad for journalism. Rather, the thinking goes, it all depends what is measured: Some metrics, like page views, incentivize the production of celebrity slide shows and other vapid content, while others, like time on a page, reward high-quality journalism. Still, there are some who doubt that even so-called ‚Äúengagement metrics‚Äù can peacefully coexist with (let alone bolster) journalistic values. This report's premise is that it will be impossible to settle these debates until we understand how people and organizations are producing, interpreting, and using metrics. I conducted an ethnographic study of the role of metrics in contemporary news by examining three case studies: Chartbeat, Gawker Media, and The New York Times. Through a combination of observation and interviews with product managers, data scientists, reporters, bloggers, editors, and others, my intention was to unearth the assumptions and values that underlie audience measures, the effect of metrics on journalists' daily work, and the ways in which metrics interact with organizational culture."],"author":["Petre, Caitlin"],"doi":["10.7916/D80293W1"],"keywords":["Journalism","Journalism‚ÄìData processing","Journalism‚ÄìTechnological innovations","Online journalism"],"publisher":["Columbia University"],"shorttitle":["The Traffic Factories"],"title":["The Traffic Factories: Metrics at Chartbeat, Gawker Media, and The New York Times"],"year":["2015"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Petre","firstName":"Caitlin"}]}},{"key":"petre2018","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"author":["Petre, Caitlin"],"doi":["10.1080/21670811.2018.1444998"],"issn":["2167-0811, 2167-082X"],"journal":["Digital Journalism"],"month":["04"],"number":["4"],"pages":["509‚Äì527"],"shorttitle":["Engineering Consent"],"title":["Engineering Consent: How the Design and Marketing of Newsroom Analytics Tools Rationalize Journalists' Labor"],"volume":["6"],"year":["2018"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Petre","firstName":"Caitlin"}]}},{"key":"phung2020","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"address":["New York, NY"],"doi":["10.1007/978-1-4899-7502-7"],"editor":["Phung, Dinh","Webb, Geoffrey I.","Sammut, Claude"],"isbn":["978-1-4899-7502-7"],"publisher":["Springer US"],"title":["Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Science"],"year":["2020"]},"creators":{"editor":[{"lastName":"Phung","firstName":"Dinh"},{"lastName":"Webb","firstName":"Geoffrey I."},{"lastName":"Sammut","firstName":"Claude"}]}},{"key":"piantadosi2022","type":"misc","fields":{"abstract":["The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) has been met with skepticism that they possess anything like human concepts or meanings.

Because conceptual role is defined by the relationships between internal representational states, meaning cannot be determined from a model's architecture, training data, or objective function, but only by examination of how its internal states relate to each other.

They deem their relationship with the platform more in hierarchical and inevitable terms while journalists from new, emerging organizations are relatively freer from the competition for clicks and strive for more quality journalism.

Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data.

Besides recounting experiences with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose non-computational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms.

On the other hand, there is the environmental conception advanced by G. E. Hutchinson [19] and R. Lewontin [21]. On this second conception, a niche is thought of as the hypervolume defined by the limiting values of all environmental variables relevant to the survival of a given species.

Unfortunately, people tend to be terrible forecasters. As Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed in a landmark 2005 study, even experts' predictions are only slightly better than chance. However, an important and underreported conclusion of that study was that some experts do have real foresight, and Tetlock has spent the past decade trying to figure out why. What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught? In Superforecasting, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people‚Äìincluding a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer‚Äìwho set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They've beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They've even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are \"superforecasters.\" In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Weaving together stories of forecasting successes (the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound) and failures (the Bay of Pigs) and interviews with a range of high-level decision makers, from David Petraeus to Robert Rubin, they show that good forecasting doesn't require powerful computers or arcane methods. It involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course.

Because assignment to the independent variables of observational data is usually nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we review the large literature produced primarily by statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades on the estimation of causal effects from observational data. We first review the now widely accepted counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal effects.

The research work was oriented to calculate and estimate the yield factor through analyzing the mean performances, variability, heritability, genetic advance, correlation coefficient and path analysis involving the yield contributing characters. The maximum yield per plant (117.51 g) was estimated in the genotype G12 (Pacific) and the minimum yield per plant (51.89 g) was recorded in the genotype G17 (Dekalb Super). The phenotypic coefficient of variation was observed higher than the genotypic coefficient of variation for all yield contributing characters. Heritability was also shown higher compared to genetic advance in comparative mean study for all the characters involved. Significant and positive correlation was observed for grain yield per plant with plant height (0.774), cob length (0.956), grain per row (0.703) and 100-seed weight (0.365). In path analysis study, positive direct correlation was recorded in days to male flowering (0.247), cob breadth (1.078), number of grains per cob (6.874) and 100-seed weight (0.595)."],"author":["Wright, Sewall"],"file":["/home/tk/Zotero/storage/PKCV4F2S/Wright_1921_Correlation and Causation.pdf"],"journal":["Journal of Agricultural Research"],"keywords":["‚úÖ"],"pages":["557‚Äì585"],"title":["Correlation and Causation"],"volume":["20"],"year":["1921"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Wright","firstName":"Sewall"}]}},{"key":"xu2020","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["Pre-training techniques have been verified successfully in a variety of NLP tasks in recent years. Despite the widespread use of pre-training models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation, while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{LayoutLM} to jointly model interactions between text and layout information across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from scanned documents. Furthermore, we also leverage image features to incorporate words' visual information into LayoutLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework for document-level pre-training. It achieves new state-of-the-art results in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.72 to 79.27), receipt understanding (from 94.02 to 95.24) and document image classification (from 93.07 to 94.42).

We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder, LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative positional relationship among different text blocks.

Nowadays, estimating causal effect from observational data has become an appealing research direction owing to the large amount of available data and low budget requirement, compared with randomized controlled trials. Embraced with the rapidly developed machine learning area, various causal effect estimation methods for observational data have sprung up. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of causal inference methods under the potential outcome framework, one of the well known causal inference framework. The methods are divided into two categories depending on whether they require all three assumptions of the potential outcome framework or not. For each category, both the traditional statistical methods and the recent machine learning enhanced methods are discussed and compared. The plausible applications of these methods are also presented, including the applications in advertising, recommendation, medicine and so on.
